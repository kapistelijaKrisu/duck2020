# Part 2 Submission
All commands are ran from the exercise specific folder.
\
NOTES: 
- this folder relies on directory tree of the whole git project. Specifically 1.10 and 1.11.
- Logs are kept from exercise to exercise just in case i managed to pull off works in my machine syndrome. In fact nothing is cleared except 2.7 to visualize the progress.

### 2.1

in the folder

### 2.2

in the folder

### 2.3

in the folder

### 2.4

answer command from the project root file: ``` docker-compose up -d --scale compute=3 ```

### 2.5

in the folder

### 2.6

in the folder. NOTE realized backend code was broken from when i copy pasted 1.11 like in spring. that fixed things as connection making didnt get "stuck". I hope other exercises won't be affected by this. -> used backend from spring upto this point. this also means that source code of 1.11 was replaced by current one

### 2.7

in the folder, git-ignored the project files folder due to size.

### 2.8

in the folder\
note other buttons than 2.8 are still broken due to not handling port changes?\
anyway fixing that is not part of this but 2.10

### 2.9

in the folder. Had to re-pull backend as it was broken in spring. If other exercises break then use backend from late spring.
